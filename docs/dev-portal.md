# Foley Developer Portal

## Goals

Ideally, the developer portal is one of the few places that will require your
attention under normal operating parameters. As a result, the portal _should_ be
a canonical source and a single pane of glass that:

- Extends our IDEs
  - Noise-reduced observability tooling for ops systems: Build Pipelines,
    high-level infrastructure metrics, logging, testing status, code quality,
    and (eventually) developer metrics[^1]

[^1]:
    Metrics are meant to be used as a mechanism to understand where there are
    opportunities to offer our colleagues support. We treat them with care and
    use them to help make decisions about what new platform features should be prioritized.
    For those curious, [here's](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124) a good look at what sort of information we'd be interested in _providing to you_
